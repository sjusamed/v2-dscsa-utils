## Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dscsa-web-scanner
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

- Choose whether to proceed or skip

#### Step 4: Export CSV
1. Review your scanned items list
2. Remove any items if needed
3. Click "Export CSV" to download the file
4. The filename will be based on your PO number (e.g., `PO12345_dscsa.csv`)

#### Reset
Click "Reset" to start a new scanning session (all scanned items will be cleared).

## Barcode Format Support

The scanner supports GS1 barcodes in multiple formats:

### Formatted (with parentheses):
```
(01)00312345678901(17)251231(10)LOT123(21)SN789
```

### Raw (without parentheses):
```
010031234567890117251231â€‹10LOT12321SN789
```

### Supported Application Identifiers:
- **01**: GTIN (14 digits)
- **10**: Lot Number (variable length)
- **17**: Expiration Date (YYMMDD format)
- **21**: Serial Number (variable length)

## CSV Output Format

The exported CSV includes these columns:
- Transaction Date
- Shipment Date
- PO Number
- Del Document Number
- Direct Purchase
- NDC
- GTIN
- Serial Number
- Lot
- Lot Expiry Date
- Product Description
- Proprietary Name
- Dosage Form
- Strength
- Container Size
- Manufacturer Name
- Sold By Name / GLN
- Sold To Name / GLN
- Ship From Name / GLN
- Ship To Name / GLN

## Data Persistence

All data is stored in browser localStorage:
- **Partners**: `dscsa_partners`
- **Products**: `dscsa_products`

Data persists across browser sessions and page refreshes. To clear all data, use your browser's developer tools to clear localStorage.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory. You can deploy these to any static hosting service.

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Browser Compatibility

This application works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript
- localStorage
- CSS Grid and Flexbox

Recommended browsers:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter** in barcode input: Add scanned item
- Focus automatically returns to barcode input after each scan for quick scanning workflow

## Tips for Best Performance

1. **Pre-configure Products**: Add commonly scanned products beforehand to speed up scanning
2. **Pre-configure Partners**: Set up your trading partners once to reuse them
3. **Use Barcode Scanner**: Physical barcode scanners work best (simulate keyboard input)
4. **Keep Browser Tab Active**: Ensure the scanner tab is active when scanning for best performance

## Troubleshooting

**Barcode not parsing:**
- Ensure the barcode contains valid GS1 Application Identifiers
- Check that GTIN (AI 01) is present in the barcode
- Try copying and pasting the barcode data to verify format

**Data not persisting:**
- Check that your browser allows localStorage
- Ensure you're not in private/incognito mode
- Check browser localStorage quota (typically 5-10MB)

**CSV not downloading:**
- Check browser download settings
- Ensure pop-ups are not blocked
- Try a different browser
